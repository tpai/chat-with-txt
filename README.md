# Chat with txt

This script allows you to ask a question to txt files using the ChatOpenAI model.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to set up the following:

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI: To use the ChatOpenAI model, you need to have an API key.

2. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable: Once you have your API key, you need to set it as an environment variable on your system.

This will be used for text embedding and LLM tasks.

## Usage

```sh
python main.py "How many GET methods are there?"
# Output:
#   There are four GET methods:
#   - Listing all resources
#   - Filtering resources
#   - Getting a resource
#   - Listing nested resources
```

## Why setting a clear boundary for documents?

The benefit of setting clear boundaries for documents is to ensure that the text content from different files remains separate and distinct when processing and generating embeddings. This is important for several reasons:

1. Context Preservation: By maintaining clear boundaries between documents, the context and meaning of the content within each document are preserved. This is crucial for accurate embeddings and search results, as it prevents unrelated content from being mixed together and potentially affecting the generated embeddings.

2. Improved Search Results: When searching for information within the indexed documents, having clear boundaries ensures that the search results are more accurate and relevant to the query. This is because the embeddings generated for each document will be based on the content within that specific document, rather than a mix of content from multiple documents.

3. Easier Debugging and Maintenance: By keeping the documents separate, it becomes easier to identify issues and maintain the code. If there is a problem with the embeddings or search results, it is simpler to trace the issue back to a specific document when the boundaries are clear.

There can be some potential disadvantages as well:

1. Increased Complexity: Introducing clear boundaries between documents can add complexity to the code, as you need to manage the separation and ensure that the boundaries are maintained throughout the processing pipeline.

2. Potential Loss of Context: If the boundaries are not set correctly or if the content within a document is closely related to the content in another document, separating them might lead to a loss of context. This could affect the quality of the embeddings and search results.

3. Less Flexibility: In some cases, it might be beneficial to allow some overlap or mixing of content between documents to capture broader context or relationships between the content. By enforcing strict boundaries, you might lose some of this flexibility.
